# BrokenChecker

This is a simple broken link checker for webpage in python 3. 
Just input the URL when prompted for it and that's it.

Things that might need improving:
* Improve the speed for remote request
* Add the ability to test all links on whole website and not just specific pages. (Done)
* Install some verification in order to test out if links are from same ROOT domain
* Might add regular expression in order to filter out redundancies.
